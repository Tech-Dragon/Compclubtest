# SUHSCAVC Testing repository

This is for the South Umpqua Highshcool Computer and AV club, it will act as a tesing ground for any and all experiments that the members of the club have in mind, I will leave this as a public respository for anybody to view as a subtle way of showing how to start your own club, if you so happen to want to start one in your school. 

I will ask that if any Users how are not a part of the SUHSCAVC (South Umpqua Highshcool Computer and AV club) wish to contribute, Please do so in a way so as to teach and instruct so that the members and others can learn and improve they're skills. I will not tolerate and and all acts of Trolling, Doxxing, Hate speach, and other such acts. You will not promote piracy and you will not attck any members of this club, they're all still in highschool and dont desearve to be treated as less than others.

And this last message is for the club, if you are seeing this message, then you are in the right spot and can can ask me questions for how to use Github and what to do with it.
